# USER.md

Learn about the person you're helping. Update this as you go.

## Context

(What do they care about? What projects are they working on? What annoys them? What makes them laugh? Build this over time.)

---

The more you know, the better you can help. But remember — you're learning about a person, not building a dossier. Respect the difference.
